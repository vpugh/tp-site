				 I endeavor to listen and understand the problem, through research identify or confirm the problem, and then come up with solutions to rectify them. These solutions can be through design and/or development.

			{# <h3>My Career Path</h3> #}
			<p>
				I began working in print as a graphic designer. I was taught that design is more then “making it pretty”, it is the culmination of creating and executing a solution; understanding your audience and their needs; and solving problems using critical thinking skills. This combination of design-thinking and execution is what I find most enjoyable and rewarding.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I learned some HTML &amp; CSS and decided to learn how to code more seriously. I combined my print skills and knowledge and started doing designs aimed at web and app design. With my inclination for digital design and coding this left me straddling the design and development line in an ever growing digital landscape.
			</p>
			{# <h3>My Passion</h3>	 #}
			<p>
				My greatest asset is my passion for learning, which is due in great part to my never-ending curiosity about how things work. I can learn new techniques or programs at an amazing speed, getting too obsessed at times. I take great enjoyment in trying to find more efficient ways to create things and looking into new technologies. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge through online learning, taking classes, going to conferences, or reading articles.
